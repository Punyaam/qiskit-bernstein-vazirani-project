# qiskit-bernstein-vazirani-project
Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm using Qiskit. This project implements the Bernstein-Vazirani quantum algorithm in Python with Qiskit, demonstrating how to construct a circuit to find a hidden binary string in a single query. The code is designed to be beginner-friendly and executable in Google Colab.
